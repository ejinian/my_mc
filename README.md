I started this project early 2022 for fun. Followed this tutorial closely:

Credits to b3agz for the wonderful and in-depth videos. b3agz's final product, however, creates a pretty unoptimized version of Minecraft. I aimed to improve multithreading, chunk generation, and player interaction. There are many things I did different and I never actually finished the playlist because of our different end goals.

## Contributing
All are welcome to contribute! We would especially love for any artists to join the team as well as game devs proficient in C#.
