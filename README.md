Recreating Minecraft in unity because why not

## About this project
I started this project early 2022 for fun. Followed this tutorial closely:

Credits to b3agz for the wonderful and in-depth videos. b3agz's final product, however, creates a pretty unoptimized version of Minecraft. I aimed to improve multithreading, chunk generation, and player interaction. There are many things I did different and I never actually finished the playlist because of our different end goals.
